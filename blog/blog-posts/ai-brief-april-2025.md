# AI Brief: April 2025

## Introduction

Keeping pace with today's AI landscape increasingly feels less like tracking a single industry and more like navigating an ever-expanding zoo.

Fascinating new creatures continually emerge—Google's powerful Gemini 2.5, OpenAI's versatile GPT-4.1, and specialized o-series, and Meta's ambitious yet controversial LLaMA 4—each boasting distinct strengths and specialized behaviors. Yet the fundamental challenge has shifted. Success is no longer about showcasing individual powerful models but rather orchestrating the entire ecosystem surrounding them.

In this April AI Brief, we'll explore how these latest models fit into practical workflows. We'll examine their capabilities, cost structures, and how advancements like large context windows are reshaping, but not eliminating, the need for established techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## April's Frontier Models

Effectively navigating the complex AI ecosystem described requires a clear profile of the latest frontier models shaping April's landscape.

### Google's Gemini 2.5 Series: Multimodal Strength and Advanced Reasoning

Google's Gemini 2.5 models significantly advance multimodal capabilities—seamlessly integrating text, images, audio, video, and code. The flagship model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, excels in complex reasoning with an extensive context window of 1 million tokens, with future plans to extend this to 2 million tokens. This makes it well-suited for detailed, multi-dimensional analyses without external retrieval dependencies.

The Gemini 2.5 Flash model emphasizes efficiency and speed through its Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture and dynamic hybrid reasoning, enabling developers to balance performance, cost, and latency. Together, these Gemini models strategically position Google to address diverse enterprise AI needs, from intensive analysis to real-time responsiveness.

### OpenAI's GPT Series: Targeted Specialization and Efficiency

OpenAI's GPT-4.1 series, introduced in April 2025, emphasizes specialized, efficient models tailored specifically for developers and enterprise use. Rather than relying solely on large, general-purpose models, the GPT-4.1 lineup offers targeted performance, affordability, and speed optimized for distinct scenarios:

- **GPT-4.1 (Flagship)**: Excels in advanced coding, precise instruction-following, and detailed long-context reasoning, achieving 54.6% accuracy on software engineering benchmarks—significantly outperforming GPT-4o's 33.2%. Its expanded context window of up to 1 million tokens enables practical handling of large documents and extensive datasets without segmenting input.
  - **Pricing**: $2 per million input tokens, $8 per million output tokens.

- **GPT-4.1 Mini**: Delivers performance comparable to GPT-4o but at approximately 85% lower cost and reduced latency, providing a robust yet affordable default choice for most enterprise applications.
  - **Pricing**: $0.40 per million input tokens, $1.60 per million output tokens.

- **GPT-4.1 Nano**: Optimized for high-frequency, simpler tasks such as classification, autocomplete, and routine data extraction, ensuring maximum speed and cost-efficiency.
  - **Pricing**: $0.10 per million input tokens, $0.40 per million output tokens.

At Bentley, these expanded context windows and cost-effective models already enable practical replacement or substantial reduction of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods for small- to medium-sized iModels, whose metadata comfortably fits within the 1-million-token context. This significantly reduces complexity and eliminates subsequent costly pipeline steps in ECSQL generation previously required to re-rank initial retrieval results due to their lower quality.

### GPT-4.5: A Strategic Shift Toward Specialized Efficiency

The introduction of GPT-4.1 represents a deliberate move by OpenAI away from the earlier GPT-4.5 model. Although GPT-4.5 delivered robust general capabilities, its higher operational costs, inconsistent real-world usability, and positioning as a research preview limited its practical appeal. OpenAI announced plans to retire GPT-4.5 by mid-July 2025, positioning the GPT-4.1 series as its optimized, production-ready successor. This transition underscores a broader industry shift from relying on increasingly large, generalist models toward targeted, efficient, and cost-effective solutions tailored specifically to enterprise needs.

### OpenAI's o-Series: Structured Problem-Solving

Complementing GPT models, OpenAI's specialized o-series target structured reasoning and complex task execution. The o3 model provides advanced multi-step reasoning and integration with external tools like Python execution and web browsing. Meanwhile, o4-mini balances analytical depth with cost-effectiveness, making it ideal for structured enterprise tasks requiring lower latency. Collectively, these models reinforce OpenAI's positioning through targeted, practical usability.

### Meta's Llama 4: Ambitious Innovation, Practical Challenges

Meta's ambitious Llama 4 series introduced multimodal capabilities, extensive context windows, and efficient Mixture-of-Experts architectures. However, its rollout faced significant controversy regarding benchmarking practices, transparency, and practical performance gaps. Additionally, Meta's licensing approach ("open-weight") drew criticism as restrictive "open-washing."

These challenges emphasize a critical lesson: ambitious technical advancements must align transparently and credibly with real-world performance and openness.

## Architecting Robust Environments – Intelligent Infrastructure and Platforms

Successfully deploying sophisticated AI models involves more than adopting advanced models and powerful hardware. Just as a well-run zoo carefully designs habitats specifically tailored to its animals' needs, effective AI deployment requires infrastructure thoughtfully integrated into existing workflows, tools, and data systems.

Recent strategies from companies like Google illustrate two critical dimensions particularly relevant given the extensive, complex engineering data—including spatial information, digital twins, and asset management records—that Bentley regularly manages:

### Seamless Integration within Existing Data Systems

Google's "data-native" approach, exemplified by technologies like AlloyDB AI and BigQuery, demonstrates clear advantages in embedding AI capabilities directly into established databases. Integrating vector embeddings and advanced analytics natively into existing platforms significantly streamlines workflows, reduces complexity, and empowers engineers and designers by naturally extending their capabilities—without relying on external or unfamiliar systems.

### Efficient Retrieval for Complex, Large-Scale Data

Rapid and precise information retrieval is critical when leveraging AI effectively at scale, particularly with large 3D models, extensive historical project data, or real-time sensor data from infrastructure assets. Google's optimized indexing methods, such as Scalable Nearest Neighbor (ScaNN), dramatically enhance search efficiency within familiar database environments. Adopting similar retrieval methods internally could accelerate access to key project information, shorten design cycles, and enhance responsiveness in asset management, directly benefiting teams managing complex engineering projects and digital twins.

These infrastructure strategies offer practical pathways for translating advanced AI capabilities into sustainable, valuable assets, naturally enhancing existing operational strengths.

## Designing "Specialized Feeding Systems" – Delivering Verified Context

Feeding AI models reliable, accurate, and context-rich information is essential to maximizing their value. Delivering this verified context involves semantic embedding models, intelligent reranking techniques, and retrieval frameworks that ensure models respond based on trusted, relevant input—rather than vague or hallucinated guesses.

### Semantic Precision: Gemini Embeddings and MRL

High-quality retrieval starts with high-quality understanding. Google's Gemini embedding models—such as gemini-embedding-exp-03-07 and text-embedding-005—currently lead across the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark, including top scores on multilingual, English, and code benchmarks. These models produce embeddings that are highly effective for tasks like semantic search, clustering, classification, and ranking—without the need for extensive fine-tuning.

Built on Gemini's base LLM, they carry forward its nuanced understanding of language and context. Many also support Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL), which enables flexible tradeoffs between embedding size and quality—allowing systems to optimize for latency, cost, or accuracy based on the task.

### Improving Relevance: Vertex AI Ranking API

Once candidate information is retrieved, reranking helps determine what truly matters. Google's Vertex AI Ranking API applies cross-attention reranking models—like text-rerank-model-01—to re-evaluate retrieved text chunks in light of the user's original query. This second-pass filtering significantly boosts Rank-1 relevance and is particularly effective for narrowing noisy retrieval results to a precise final set.

The API integrates natively with platforms like Google Cloud's AlloyDB, allowing developers to build pipelines that combine embedding-based retrieval with deep neural reranking—all via SQL or API calls.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Long Context as Alternatives

To mitigate hallucination and keep answers grounded in reliable information, many AI applications use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) -- a process where external data is retrieved, passed into the prompt, and referenced by the model during generation. Google's Vertex AI RAG Engine provides a fully managed RAG workflow: handling chunking, embedding, indexing, querying, and prompt assembly.

However, for tasks involving well-structured, medium-scale data, newer models like Gemini with 1-million-token context windows open up alternative strategies. These large windows enable the direct inclusion of more raw content into a single prompt, potentially simplifying or even replacing traditional retrieval + rerank steps—particularly when paired with high-quality semantic ordering.

Feeding models verified context—through top-tier embeddings, intelligent reranking, and thoughtfully designed retrieval workflows—is essential to ensuring responses are useful, accurate, and grounded. These tools form the backbone of high-performance AI systems and offer practical levers to boost quality without overcomplicating infrastructure.

## Defining "Interaction Pathways" – Enabling Agentic Collaboration

AI's greatest potential lies not in individual strength, but in effective collaboration among specialized agents. Achieving this requires clear, standardized communication.

Two emerging open standards—Agent-to-Agent (A2A), just introduced this April, and the recently established Multi-agent Collaboration Protocol (MCP)—address this directly:

- **A2A** provides simple, standardized communication, enabling agents to efficiently exchange context and tasks without human intervention.
- **MCP** structures more complex interactions, defining how multiple agents coordinate tasks, share context, and dynamically manage workflows.

A2A builds strategically upon MCP, creating a cohesive foundation that facilitates seamless cross-framework and cross-team collaboration—particularly valuable for enabling coordinated agentic workflows across Bentley's diverse engineering software and infrastructure solutions.

## Conclusion

This month, we've witnessed meaningful shifts in the AI Zoo—not simply in terms of increasingly impressive individual models, but in the rapid maturation of the ecosystems that surround and support them. April's announcements reinforced critical trends we've highlighted in previous briefs: the push toward specialized yet efficient models (OpenAI's GPT-4.1), greater emphasis on robust semantic embedding and retrieval systems (Gemini embeddings and Vertex AI reranking), and newly standardized protocols enabling seamless agent-to-agent collaboration (A2A building on MCP).

These developments are not isolated innovations, but clear reflections of the broader strategic evolution occurring across the industry. Success in AI is no longer defined by isolated model performance alone. Instead, sustainable advantage now lies in thoughtfully orchestrated ecosystems that integrate powerful models with intelligent infrastructure, verified context pipelines, and reliable, agentic interactions.

    description:
      "China's new measures took effect on September 1, requiring all synthetic content to be explicitly and implicitly labeled, a move designed to enforce state control over the information ecosystem. The rules mandate two types of labels: visible indicators (text, audio, or graphics) that clearly inform users when content is AI-generated, and digital watermarks or metadata embedded within files. Top platforms including WeChat, Douyin, and Weibo rapidly implemented mechanisms to comply. The law introduces a three-tier classification system—confirmed, possible, and suspected AI-generated content—setting a precedent as the world's first nationally enforced set of requirements for broad identification of synthetic media.",

A 'frontier model' is defined as a foundation model trained on computing power greater than 10^26 FLOPs. All frontier developers must publish a transparency report before or concurrently with deploying a new model, and may not retaliate against employees who disclose information about dangers. Large frontier developers (over $500M revenue) must create and publish AI safety frameworks, conduct assessments of catastrophic risks, and report to California's Office of Emergency Services on a recurring basis. Failure to comply can subject large developers to civil penalties up to $1 million per violation, enforceable by the California Attorney General. The law becomes effective January 1, 2026.",

    description:
      "The U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly 99-1 to strip a ten-year federal moratorium on state AI regulations from the Republican budget reconciliation bill ('One Big Beautiful Bill'). The moratorium would have prevented states from enforcing their own AI regulations for a decade. The amendment, co-sponsored by Senators Cantwell, Markey, and Blackburn, received bipartisan support after intense opposition from 40 state attorneys general, 260 state lawmakers, and over 130 advocacy groups. The vote preserves states' rights to regulate AI and ensures a diverse regulatory landscape rather than federal preemption.",
